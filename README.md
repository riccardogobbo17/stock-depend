# stock-depend
HW - Statistical Methods in Data Science

Our purpose is to study the dependency among some standard measures of stock relative performance. For doing this, weâ€™re going to collect the daily closing prices between 1st January 2003 and 1st January 2008 for a certain number of stocks (exactly 60) considering those in the S&P500 index. Our initial hypotesis is that stocks from the same GICS sector will tend to be clustered together since the main idea is that they should iteract more with each other. Hence, we want to test this assumption.
